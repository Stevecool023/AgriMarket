# This is a placeholder file for views or controllers that handle the interaction between the website's users and the data models. We'll define routes, request handlers, and templates to display information to users and manage their interactions. The implementation of views depends on the web framework used. If we're using Flask, for example, we would define routes and request handlers in this file.


# The actual implementation of the management and view classes may vary depending on the web framework and tools used to build the agricultural website. We'll need to integrate these classes with the web framework to create a fully functional website.
