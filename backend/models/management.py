# This is a placeholder file for managing classes that handle CRUD operations for Equipment, Products, Transations, Buyers, and Owners. The implementation of these classes depends on the framework used(e.g., Flask, Django). We should create classes or views that allow us to create, read, update, and delete records for our models.


# The actual implementation of the management and view classes may vary depending on the web framework and tools used to build our agricultural website. We'll need to integrate these classes with our web framework to create a fully functional website.
